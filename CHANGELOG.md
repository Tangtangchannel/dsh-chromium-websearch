# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) with the usual `0.x`
allowance: minor releases may break compatibility.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-28

### Changed

- Default `minResults` is now 3. A single hit from an engine that half-blocked
  the query used to count as an answer; now the search falls through to the next
  engine instead.
- `engines.node` is `>=22`. The DevTools transport uses the global `WebSocket`,
  which Node 20 does not have, so the previous `>=20` declaration was wrong. CI
  now runs Node 22 and 24 instead of 20 and 22.

### Added

- `web_fetch` refuses loopback, LAN, link-local, and carrier-grade NAT targets
  (`lib/net-guard.js`) before navigation, so a page the model asks for cannot
  reach a router admin page or a port on the machine itself. `allowPrivateHosts`
  opens everything (`true`) or only the listed hosts (`['nas.lan']`).
- The JSONL trace records which engine produced a result.
- A CDP smoke test with a hand-rolled WebSocket server, so the Node 22
  requirement is enforced by a test rather than assumed.

### Fixed

- The Chromium sandbox stays enabled except on Linux where the launch cannot
  work with it on (running as root or inside a container). It used to be
  disabled unconditionally.
- ZIP inflation is capped at `max(compressedSize * 20, 64 MB)` per entry, so a
  hostile archive cannot expand past memory while still being structurally
  valid.
- `SECURITY.md` states the two remaining gaps in one place: DNS rebinding is not
  defended against, and the downloaded browser archive is not signature-checked.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-28

### Fixed

- Publish pipeline: the first release was blocked by npm's staged-publishing
  placeholder, so 0.2.1 re-releases the same tree with a fresh version.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-28

First public release, as `dsh-chromium-websearch`.

### Added

- `web_search` provider driving a real headful Chromium over CDP (Bing,
  DuckDuckGo, Baidu) with redirect unwrapping and bot-wall settling.
- `web_fetch` provider that strips scripts/styles/svg/iframes and returns clean
  HTML or text, with `bodyFormat` selection.
- Three modes: `anonymous` (disposable profile), `signed-in` (kept profile,
  login window), `personal` (an existing Chrome profile directory).
- Automatic browser provisioning: when no Chromium build is installed, the
  stable Chrome for Testing build is downloaded once into
  `~/.dsh/browser-web/chromium` and reused. No postinstall script, no user step.
- Dependency-free ZIP reader for the provisioning path.
- Optional JSONL trace of navigations (`journal`), disabled with `journal: false`.

### Changed

- Package published as `dsh-chromium-websearch` (formerly the local
  `@local/dsh-web-browser`); the composition patch and install docs follow the
  new name. On-disk state file names are unchanged.
- GPL-3.0-or-later license.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-10-27

- Internal iteration: CDP client, search extractors, mode handling.
