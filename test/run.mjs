 * Offline test runner: the cases `npm test` is expected to execute.
 *
 * The suites register cases through `test/harness.mjs` and never run on import,
 * so `node --test` would report every file as a passing test while executing
 * nothing. This runner drives the offline sections explicitly and fails the
 * process when a case throws.
 *
 * Browser and network are not required: fixtures and live sections live behind
 * `npm run accept`.
